        <h2>
            <strong>The best Neighborhood is the Richmond neighborhood</strong>

        <p>
            I love <strong>Richmond neighborhood</strong> because I live there and the environment is very nice. Also, it is near <strong>Golden Gate Park.</strong>

        <h2>
            <strong>The worst neighborhood is <em>ChinaTown</em></strong>
        </h2>
        
        <p>
            I hate <em>ChinaTown</em> because there are too many people and the environment is not that good.</p>
